## Key Metrics at a Glance

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| 🚗 Total Vehicles | **15,103,263** |
| 📊 Average Daily Traffic | **1,006,884** vehicles |
| ⏰ Busiest Hour | **10:00 AM** and **4:00 PM** |
| 🚦 Congestion Rate | **26.3%** of the time |

---

## Traffic Patterns

### Daily Volume Trend
- Traffic volumes are highest on **weekdays** (average 1,055,842/day)
- **Weekend traffic is 17% lower** than weekday traffic
- Consistent patterns observed throughout the study period

### Peak Hours
- **Morning Peak:** 10:00 AM
- **Evening Peak:** 4:00 PM
- Peak hour traffic is approximately 2x the off-peak volume

## Key Issues Identified

1. **6,605 bottleneck hours** detected across all intersections
2. **3,074 queue-forming events** requiring attention
3. Some detectors showing intermittent sensor issues (< 1% of data)

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
- Review signal timing at high-congestion intersections
- Investigate queue formation patterns during peak hours

### Medium-Term Improvements
- Consider adaptive signal control during peak periods
- Implement weekend-specific timing plans

### Data Quality
- Schedule maintenance for detectors showing flat signals
- Continue monitoring data quality metrics
