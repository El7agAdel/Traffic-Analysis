## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Data Cleaning
1. Removed report headers from XLSX files
2. Standardized column names
3. Parsed timestamps to datetime format
4. Extracted intersection_id, detector_id, direction, and lane from detector descriptions
5. Validated numeric ranges (volume >= 0, occupancy 0-100%)

### 3.2 Data Transformation
1. Aggregated 15-minute data to hourly intervals
2. Computed congestion index based on occupancy thresholds
3. Detected bottlenecks using consecutive high-occupancy periods
4. Generated quality flags for missing data, outliers, and flat signals

### 3.3 Data Integration
1. Merged hourly data with historical profiles
2. Joined with intersection locations
3. Created unified analytics table with 34 columns

## 7. Recommendations

1. **High Congestion Intersections:** Focus traffic management on intersections with consistently high occupancy
2. **Peak Hour Management:** Implement signal timing optimization during AM (10:00) and PM (16:00) peaks
3. **Data Quality:** Investigate detectors with frequent flat signals or outliers
4. **Weekend Operations:** Consider different timing plans for weekends (17% lower volume)
